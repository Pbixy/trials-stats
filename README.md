### trials-stats

Lets you look up some Trials stats.  Its pretty manual, and currently only works for XBox.

Usage:

    node app.js <gamertag> <character_index>

Character index is zero-based.  So, the character at the top of your list in Destiny is the 0 one.


#### TODO

* get Elos working
* pretty print the results instead of plopping them in a file
* specify the output type (json, csv...?)
