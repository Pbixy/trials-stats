### trials-stats

Lets you look up some Trials stats.  Its pretty manual, and currently only works for XBox.

Usage:

    node app.js <gamertag> <character_index>

Character index is zero-based.  So, the character at the top of your list in Destiny is the 0 one.  Once you've run that, you
can get the Elo and Light stats.

    node elo-light.js <gamertag>
